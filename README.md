<!-- Assumptions for the main HTML milestone:
- Minimal amount of css used (will be added on later)
- We have used v-for statements in the doc where we felt might be necessary for future use; not in use currently
- VueJs CDN link has been added for future use
- Lot of work pending for upcoming milestones! -->
